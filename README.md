## Hi there 👋

I’m Shivam, a Cloud & DevOps enthusiast with strong experience in:

☁️ Microsoft Azure (Production-level exposure)

🧱 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

🐧 Linux (Interview + real-world focused)

🌐 Networking fundamentals (deep clarity, not rote learning)

🔐 Cloud Security & Identity (RBAC, Conditional Access, MFA)

🤖 Automation using PowerShell & DevOps pipelines

I strongly believe in:

“If you can explain it simply, you truly understand it.”
